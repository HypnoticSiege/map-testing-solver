    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 1,</span>Next Thursday, Miss Trabulsi came to class with her arms full of small <span class="nobreak">branches . . . fig</span>, almond, apple, pear, cherry. Some were still bare, others just starting to get blossoms or tiny green leaves. "You've no idea," she told the class, "how far I had to drive to find trees that weren't leafed out yet. Way, way up high in the mountains. Now, what are we going to do with these branches?"</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 2,</span>She gave each boy a good-sized twig and then handed out paper and charcoal. But before she would let them start drawing, they had to look at their twigs. Just look, for a long time. The boys glanced at each other, grinning. This was <span data-ignore="" class="hidden">,begin italics,</span><i class="decorated-spoken-styles">really</i><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">,end italics,</span> weird.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 3,</span>"Hold it straight up before you," said Miss Trabulsi. "See the pattern that the little twigs make, branching off the main stem. Now turn it a little, and see how the pattern changes. Now look at it from above, as if you were a bird. And from below, like a little ant crawling up the branch."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 4,</span>Rami thought it was pretty dumb at first. But as he studied his bumpy fig tree twig, he found himself getting more and more absorbed. New designs appeared with each change in perspective. He glanced around the room. The grins had faded. Each boy's eyes were now focused on the gray twig in his hand.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 5,</span>"Do you see how beautiful it is, boys, when you really look at it?" Miss Trabulsi said softly. "Do you see how many different ways there are to look at something as ordinary as a twig? That's the way with <span class="nobreak">everything . . . there's</span> always more than one way to look at it. Remember that. Now, choose the view you like best and start drawing."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 6,</span>That night, as he and Marwan got ready to sleep, Rami described what they had done in art. Tired and scruffy, Marwan was sitting listlessly on the edge of the bed. He peered up at Rami for a moment.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 7,</span>"She had you draw live twigs with dead ones? That beats everything."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 8,</span>"It does!" said Rami earnestly. "You have to look at your twig really hard, Marwan, and turn it different ways to see how it changes. Miss Trabulsi says that's true about everything in the <span class="nobreak">world—you</span> can look at it more than one way."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 9,</span>"Well," said Marwan with a heavy sigh, "there's only one way to look at me and my pushcart, and it'll never change. And I don't want to hear any more about your Miss Trabulsi!"</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 10,</span>"I thought you liked her," said Rami in a small voice.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 11,</span>"Like her? Don't make me mad at you. What good would it do me to like her? A girl like that can marry a doctor. What would she want with a guy who pushes mouse traps and toilet scrubbers around on a cart? Especially a guy who can't even say two words to her. Leave me alone, I want to sleep."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 12,</span>Rami turned off the light and got into the other side of the bed. He'd felt so excited, telling Marwan about looking at the twig, and now everything was spoiled. Maybe his friend <span data-reason="ttsOnly" data-voice-alt="Mo-ha-med">Mohammad</span> was right after all.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 13,</span>But before he went to sleep, he had to get in the last word. "Just the same, Marwan, you better try it. Your pushcart's just <span class="nobreak">a—a</span> big twig."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 14,</span>A long moment passed. Then Marwan mumbled, "Shut up and sleep."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 15,</span>As the next two weeks slipped by, the weather got steadily hotter. The end of the school year was drawing near, and Rami had run out of ideas about his brother and his art teacher. He felt almost as discouraged as Marwan. His big plan was going nowhere fast.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 16,</span>One day, however, he came home with good news. "We're going to have an art exhibit," he announced to the family at supper. "It'll be part of the arts and crafts show next week. Miss Trabulsi's going to put up our best pictures in the yard of the community building, where everybody can see them. You've got to come."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 17,</span>"To see pictures of twigs from every possible angle," muttered Marwan. "I can't wait."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 18,</span>"You bet!" said Rami. Hope started to leaf out once more.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 19,</span>On the morning of the crafts show, Rami and <span data-reason="ttsOnly" data-voice-alt="Mo-ha-med">Mohammad</span> arrived at the community building bright and early to help Miss Trabulsi. With two or three other boys, they thumbtacked the pictures on a long display board. They worked <span class="nobreak">busily—until</span> Rami spilled the whole box of thumbtacks. He made sure they fell into a pail of dirty water that had been used to mop the courtyard tiles.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 20,</span>"Never mind!" he shouted before Miss Trabulsi could say anything about fishing them out. "I'll go get you a new box."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 21,</span>Miss Trabulsi called to him as he started to dash off. "You could look for that man with the housewares <span class="nobreak">pushcart—"</span></p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 22,</span>"Good idea!" Rami called over his shoulder, and off he went.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 23,</span>Ten minutes later he was <span class="nobreak">back—with</span> Marwan, a box of thumbtacks in hand. Marwan's cheeks were a little dark, but he had on a clean shirt. Rami had seen to that.</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 24,</span>"My goodness, what service!" said Miss Trabulsi, pushing back the baseball cap she wore in the hot sun. "But you didn't have <span class="nobreak">to. . . ."</span></p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 25,</span>"No problem," said Marwan. "A pleasure."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 26,</span>"Well, thank you so much! What do I owe you?"</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 27,</span>"Nothing. I'll just have a look at these pictures while I'm here." Marwan strolled around for a few minutes, then turned back to Miss Trabulsi. "This is good work, really nice. <span class="nobreak"><span data-reason="ttsOnly" data-voice-alt="i">I</span> . . . did</span> some drafting when I was in engineering school, but nothing as pretty as these."</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 28,</span>"Oh?" said Miss Trabulsi. "You studied engineering?"</p>
    <p class="paragraphNumber decorated-spoken-styles"><span data-ignore="" class="hidden">paragraph 29,</span>Marwan nodded. "Beirut, a couple of years. Until the money dried up." He shifted his weight, cleared his throat, coughed slightly. "By the way, my little brother seems to be learning a lot in art class. He says you're really teaching them how <span class="nobreak">to—to</span> look at the world."</p>
